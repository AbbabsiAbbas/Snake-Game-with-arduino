# Snake Game on Arduino

This repository contains the source code for a Snake Game built on an Arduino platform. The game is controlled using a joystick and displayed on an LCD screen. It's a fun and interactive game that showcases how to interface Arduino with hardware components like a joystick and an LCD display.

## Features

- **Joystick Control:** The snake moves in response to joystick input, allowing for smooth and intuitive gameplay.
- **LCD Display:** The game interface is displayed on an LCD screen, showing the snake, food, and current score.
- **Game Logic:**
  - Snake movement logic that updates the position in real-time based on joystick directions.
  - Collision detection with walls and the snake itself to end the game.
  - Scoring system that increments each time the snake eats food.

## Hardware Required

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno, Nano)
- Joystick module
- LCD display (e.g., 16x2 LCD)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard (optional)
